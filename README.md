# Bulgar Development HUD

This is HUD is based on the default qb-core hud, but it redesigned and used in Bulgar OG RP. You can use this HUD for your needs and do your own changes to it, but cannot resell it etc.

### RENAME THE RESOURCE TO `bd-hud` AFTER DOWNLOAD

# Things you should know:

- To open the menu in-game the **default key** is **"I"** or you can type **"/menu"**
- Your settings will **always** be **stored locally**, so even if you delete the resource it **will** keep your current settings. The **only** way you can wipe the local storage sucessfully is by clicking the **"Reset Settings"** button on the in-game menu
- If you want the new super snazzy sound effects for the menu, you'll need to download the latest update of [interact-sound](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/interact-sound) <br>
  (comes with new open menu sound, close menu sound, click menu sound)
- If you receive `attempt to index a nil value (global 'Lang')` in your F8 console, the fastest way you can fix that issue is by downloading a new version via txAdminRecipe but if you are unable to do that because of the progress you’ve made on your existing build; you’ll have to unfortunately go through and download each one from the GitHub which I do not recommend. Save yourself a lot of time and pain by just downloading the recipe!
